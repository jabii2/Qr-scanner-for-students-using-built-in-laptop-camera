Hello, I’m new to this, and I am trying to create a unique ID for students that can be scanned using a QR code scanner. After the student scans their ID, the output will display the student’s information. Additionally, after they scan, a notification will be sent to the parents to inform them that their student is at school.

Right now, I’m working on a prototype using my laptop camera. I’m using Visual Studio Code, by the way. I need help fixing some issues.

My camera is working perfectly fine.

I converted the text “123456” (which is the student’s ID) into a QR code. However, when I scan the QR code, it doesn’t work. I also tried using online scanner sites, and I can see the result there.
